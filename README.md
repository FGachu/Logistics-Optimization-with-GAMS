# Dairy Delivery Optimization: TSP & VRPTW Models

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains **GAMS models** for solving two classic **logistics and optimization problems**:
1. **Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSP-TW)**
2. **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)**

These models are implemented in **GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System)** and solve real-world logistics challenges using mathematical programming techniques.

## üìù Problem Descriptions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TSP-TW)**
A farmer delivers self-produced dairy products to **40 customers**. Each customer has a predefined **time window** within which they must receive their delivery. The objective is to **minimize the total travel distance** while ensuring all time constraints are met.

#### **Model Outputs**:
- **Optimal delivery route**
- **Total distance traveled**
- **Arrival times at each customer**
- **Customer visit sequence**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)**
The farmer expands his fleet to **3 vehicles**, each serving a maximum of **8 customers**. Due to equipment failure, only **20 customers** can be served. The problem is extended to a VRPTW, where each vehicle follows an optimized route while considering time constraints.

#### **Model Outputs**:
- **Optimal routes for each vehicle**
- **Assignment of customers to vehicles**
- **Total travel distance for all vehicles**

## üöÄ How to Run the Models
1. **Install GAMS**: Ensure GAMS is installed on your system.
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dairy-Delivery-Optimization.git
   cd Dairy-Delivery-Optimization
   ```
3. **Run the GAMS models**:
   - For **TSP-TW**:
     ```sh
     gams TSP_Model.gms
     ```
   - For **VRPTW**:
     ```sh
     gams VRPTW_Model.gms
     ```
4. **Check the results** in the generated `.lst` and `.txt` files.
